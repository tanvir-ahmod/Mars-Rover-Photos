## Getting Started

```
Works on Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1 Canary 2
```

To get started at first clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/tanvir-ahmod/MarsRoverPhotos.git
```

### NASA Open API Key

This app uses the [NASA Open API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to get and load pictures of Rovers from Mars. To use the API, you will need to generate API key. See the [NASA Open API](https://api.nasa.gov/) for instructions.

Once you have the key, add the key to the `Constants` file (`~/utills/Constants`)

```
 const val API_KEY = "DEMO_KEY" // Replace with API keys
```

The app is still usable with default API key
